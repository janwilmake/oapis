Created the initial version of this. Please note, previous work is at https://github.com/janwilmake/openapisearch but it had a different idea.

# Thursday, 16th of January, 2025

âœ… Look at openapisearch; Find back my hardcoded dataset of openapis and create a KV from that that goes from server to the location. Use this as JSON as a fallback if the server openapi wasn't found - ðŸ”¥SIMPLICITYðŸ§¡

âœ… I need this macroview for all apis in the KV that I like, together with all my own APIs. I need this to be available as a context publicly. An agent using this prompt could then fetch multiple overviews to choose operations and getting their summary: `macroview => overview => summary => build.`

âœ… OpenAPI search should work, at least, and oapis can be powered by it. Find ways the data can remain most fresh.

âœ… Having this, now I can also make a macro-overview, that has a single line per openapi; or maybe use tag-level overview.

âœ… Get function to get all repos (had i not tht in stars.uithub?)

âœ… Get all https://openapi.forgithub.com/janwilmake/[repo]/overview and also include repo url.
